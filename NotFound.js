```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This code uses `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` from `react-router-dom` to define routes for a React application.  The issue is that if the `NotFound` component has a nested route, it will cause problems.  For instance:

```javascript
function NotFound() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>404 Not Found</h1>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/error-details" element={<ErrorDetails />} />
      </Routes>
    </div>
  );
}
```
This setup leads to unexpected routing behavior because nested routes within the `NotFound` component interfere with the catch-all functionality of the parent `Route path="*"`.  The nested route creates a conflict, preventing the expected 404 behavior.
